\usage{
prepInputsFireRegimePolys(
  url = NULL,
  destinationPath = tempdir(),
  studyArea = NULL,
  rasterToMatch = NULL,
  type = "ECOREGION"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{url}{character. URL from which to download and prepare fire regime polygons.
Defaults are provided for Canadian ecodistrict, ecoregion, ecoprovince, and ecozone.}

\item{destinationPath}{character. Path to directory where data will be downloaded.}

\item{studyArea}{\code{sf} object corresponding to the study area of interest.}

\item{rasterToMatch}{TODO}

\item{type}{character. The polygon type to use:
Must be one of "ECODISTRICT", "ECOREGION" (default), "ECOPROVINCE", or "ECOZONE".
If \code{url} to BEC zones shapefile is provided, can also be one of "BECSUBZONE" or
"BECZONE".}
}
\description{
Create fire regime polygons for \code{scfmRegime}.
}
\note{
\code{prepInputs()} is used internally, which uses \code{rasterToMatch} but not \code{studyArea} for
reprojecting. Therefore, if not passing \code{rasterToMatch}, you should ensure the output
crs matches what you were expecting, and subsequently reproject if needed.
