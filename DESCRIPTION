Title: Tools and Utilities for Working With the SCFM Wildfire Simulation Model
Description: The original fire model is described by Cumming et al. (1998),
    and more accessibly in Armstrong and Cumming (2003).
    It has recently been implemented as a collection of 'SpaDES' modules by
    Cumming, McIntire, Eddy, and Chubaty, available from
    <https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/scfm>.
